## UCSD CSE 291D  SP19
#### Author: Ziqi Gan
#### Project: Particle Based Fluids

## Features
This project implements:
### Basic SPH Solver
### Acceleration Structure
For faster neighborhood search I implemented a uniform grid.  
- The simulation space is divided into small cubic cells.
- Each particle is associated with one of the cells. 
- The cell length equals to the support radius of the kernel. 
- For each particle, loop through $3^3 = 27$ cells to find all its neighbors.
### Divergence Free Solver
### High Viscosity Fluid
The DFSPH paper also introduces an implicit viscosity solver, 
### Air-Fluid Interaction
